# Time_Series_Hybrid_XGboost


The XGBoost Hybrid solution employs a two-cycle approach to enhance model performance.
Phases:
1. The first cycle involves automatic optimization based on statistical tests, which meticulously evaluates feature significance and parameter settings, ensuring a robust foundation for the model.
This phase is complex yet carefully measured, systematically refining the data inputs. 
2. In the second phase, the insights and results obtained from the first cycle are strategically injected into the XGBoost framework, allowing it to leverage the optimized features and parameters effectively. This hybrid methodology results in a more powerful predictive model, capable of addressing intricate patterns in the data while maintaining high accuracy and efficiency.
